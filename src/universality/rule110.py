"""Implementation of the Rule 110 cellular automaton.

The original research code used NumPy for efficiency.  To keep the exercises
selfâ€‘contained and avoid heavy dependencies we provide a small pure Python
implementation that mirrors the behaviour.  The update rule is

``U(a, b, c) = b + c - b*c - a*b*c``.

The :func:`evolve` function returns the full history as a list of lists so that
it works in environments without NumPy.  When NumPy is available the history is
converted to a :class:`numpy.ndarray` for convenience.
